# Mutation Testing Demo

This project aims to provide an introduction to mutation testing and provide examples of the capabilities of this type of testing.

This project currently only contains a Java example but time permitting I will investigate tools for other languages.

This project provides the supporting examples from this [blog post](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/09/25/mutation-testing.html)
